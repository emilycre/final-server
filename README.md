* Why do we get "MongoError: topology was destroyed" when running tests?
* Right now we get all comments when we hit the `/api/v1/comments/:characterId` route.
  Fix the route so it only returns comments by `characterId`
* Update the routes so that the user's email is stored in the comment
* Add the ability to update and delete a comment
